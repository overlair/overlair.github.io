				<strong class="overlair-name">overlair</strong> is an informal research lab borne out of the notion that computers are <em>magic</em>. Run by <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnulls">John Knowles</a>, it is focused on creative digital tools and multi-media applications, and intent on finding simple, powerful and accessible ways to work with text, graphics and sounds.

			The magic of computers comes not only from what we can do, but also from what we can see. Computers allow us to visually engage with information and media for purposes of creation, communication, learning, analysis, entertainment and more.

				Computers are the medium for these <em>magical worlds</em>. More than lit screens, we get meaningful representations and artifacts, assemblages of text, graphics, sounds and links, useful for making sense of our world and communicating it to others.

				<p>

					Like pen and paper, computers (and their interfaces) faciliate the process of externalizing our internalizations, making them real and interactable.  Through the shaping of these forms, into representations (media) and artifacts (documents), we gain conceptual appendages, from to-dos to tomes.

					<strong class="overlair-name">overlair</strong> serves as the surface on which I am examinging these digital systems, focusing mainly on hypermedia organizers and music production tools. Recognizing that these systems have a multitude of uses and users, in my work I seek to privilege the amateur over the professional, the personal over the business, and the human over the machine.
