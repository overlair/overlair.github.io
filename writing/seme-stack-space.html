				<h2> Seme | Stack | Space</h2>
				<p id="7f9f05a1-5c3c-48b0-9eec-0bb23fee0e72" class="">We can think of applications as being the product of three main levels of abstraction-seme, stack, space. These levels organize the content, containers, and contexts of the application. 

				<p id="c44ca6e0-5bb9-4c2c-8a54-ff2a645f8bc2" class="">The decision to break down into three levels derives from two sources: Engelbart’s famous phrase "thought vectors in concept space”, and Hal Abelson/Jay Sussman's description of language as having “primitive expressions, a means of combination, and a means of abstraction”. 
				</p>
					<p>From these, we can map: 
						<ul>
							<li>
								primitive → thoughts → <strong>semes</strong>
							</li>
							<li>
								 means of combination → vectors → <strong>stacks</strong>
							</li>
							<li>
								means of abstraction → concept space → <strong>spaces</strong>

				<p id="498c2bb3-0360-414e-a9e3-9c12eec52be3" class="">A common pattern in many new media softwares is to use a notion of <em>blocks </em>as the primitive for constructing media documents. By linking these blocks together, one can create larger and larger media-scapes, in which associations and hierarchies exist as fundamental parts of the structure. </p>

				<p id="f9c72953-c275-4094-b860-40f989367cb7" class="">Instead of using <em>blocks t</em>o describe this material<em>,</em> we’ll borrow a term from semantics—<em>seme—</em> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seme_(semantics)">smallest unit of meaning</a>. We can think of <em>semes</em> as the unit of <em>discretization</em>, or <em>decomposition, </em>in our documents. In order to express higher-level meanings, we construct structures and networks from these low-level blocks.</p>

<p id="eaeee539-bbd8-46b6-87ba-0823de5d4b77" class="">This idea is already familiar to us. We break our songs into choruses and verses, books into chapters, essays into paragraphs, movies and play into scenes, reports into sections. When we create media, we do so as a composition of parts. Blocks feel more ergonomic because they <em>are</em> more ergonomic. </p>

<p id="880c53bf-5b9a-4dde-8b83-65bb3752e063" class="">In having a uniform type serving as the foundation for the database, we can create media with a consistent material. If we consider the idea of <em>blocks </em>in two types of softwares—coding “journals” like Jupyter Notebooks<em>, </em>and notation systems like Roam and Notion—we see how the <em>block </em>changes our interaction with the documents. </p>

<p id="46a14c2a-00a6-4946-b41f-74216d775832" class="">In Jupyter, we no longer have to run programs as a full unit, but instead we can decompose it into comprehendible parts, and run these in a serial fashion. We can intersperse our code with other media—text and graphics—in order to more appropriately represent the nature of the inputs and outputs of a program, as well as the program itself. Creating, deleting, editing and other interactions with these blocks are uniform, so we can apply the same patterns to different types of blocks. </p>

<p id="ba8a80c7-2224-42f5-9837-84527fd90e82" class="">In Roam and Notion, we no longer write documents as monolithic structures, but instead as the composition of small units of text or other media. This pattern of using nesting, links and transclusions allows us to fold our documents onto themselves, creating interconnected—rather than independent—experiences. </p>

<p id="df6d857d-99cb-481b-8c90-f2d05f3c100d" class="">Blocks give a consistent interface of interaction. We understand a block, what we can do with it, how we can combine it with other blocks. To make an oft-made reference, these blocks serve in the same way as Legos, allowing us to build up and tear down creations of media units.</p>

<p id="2faa1630-9a29-4350-b65d-e46282f18d97" class="">In addition to a system of blocks, we also need useful ways of visually binding these together into groups. To express meta-block properties like nestings, transclusions and links, it is not enough to have a backend that can represent these features—we need meaningful ways of presenting these groups of blocks on screen that emphasize and represents the structure of their connections. </p>

<p id="d1fa638c-7c7a-442e-84cf-958a0624124e" class="">In dealing with digital object<strong>s</strong>—<em>plural—</em>we need ways of aligning and ordering them; mechanisms for selecting, sorting, filtering and searching them; ways of handling operations that can be performed on them; and controls for interacting directly with them by dragging and dropping. </p>

<p id="1bd38610-9ad6-40d3-9806-59e8c212a7a5" class="">The benefit of <em>stacks</em> is their ability to impose a dimensionality (x, y, z) on a set of objects, such that they live in alignment within a single container. We <em>bind</em> objects to some backing structure, such that we can have a consistent formatted display, and interact with the objects as a group for selecting and manipulating.</p>

<p id="6050c276-ef4c-450a-a736-419a05f9063d" class="">Briefly, we can consider the three dominate forms of <em>stacks</em> within interfaces: the <strong>list</strong>, the <strong>grid</strong> and the <strong>canvas</strong>. Of these, we can consider the <strong>list</strong> and the <strong>grid</strong> to be <em>fixed, </em>while the <strong>canvas</strong> can be said to be <em>free, </em>in terms of the layout of the contained elements.  </p>

<p id="131a8d7c-0636-4eb3-bdc7-4e97e4de4d3a" class="">We see the <strong>list</strong> in many forms: in timelines of content, file systems, and more. For much of the text-based media content on our devices, we prefer a one-dimensional stacking of rectangular blocks, like the lines on a page. </p>

<p id="8dfa1718-6b39-4f38-8550-385c6b6d6a25" class="">We see the <strong>grid </strong>in fewer forms, mainly to display media items like photos or videos, or to present a set of icon-based controls/content (like the iPhone home screen). We use grids to pack more items per unit of screen space, while we use lists to present fuller shapes for text-based media. </p>

<p id="50d64565-67d1-4d2c-bdd1-f7523d338c77" class="">An alternative to <strong>lists</strong> and <strong>grids</strong> is <strong>canvases</strong>, or spaces in which objects exist in a <em>free, </em>rather than <em>fixed</em> state. While <strong>lists</strong> and <strong>grids</strong> allow us to hand over the task of lining up objects, <strong>canvases</strong><em> </em>afford a higher-level of user control over the size and location of our objects. </p>

<p id="79f8bb09-6f13-4c2b-8b92-5cf194334e9c" class="">For a heterogenous set of objects (in terms of their size and shape), this type of layout is preferred. Fixed interfaces perform best over homogenous sets of objects, though there are ways to handle a diverse set of object forms. </p>

<p id="ac441254-4d1d-4466-a65f-8e500c9dff17" class="">What I think is missing from these discussions is the making good of the “location” metaphor. If we have spaces, we have places. If we have places, we have maps. The act of using maps, either internal or external, to navigate spaces is central to the nature of interacting with them.  We must consider the ways that we build abstractions over spaces, in terms of places, paths, landmarks, areas, and the way we might describe these objects with names, aliases, properties and classes. We abstract locations and sets of locations, building understandings through the locality and arrangement of these abstracted pieces, stitching them together into understandings of larger and larger landscapes. We might filter our views based on certain properties or classes, and construct the landscape in a reduced dimensionality. </p>

<p id="4ea6be1c-5b1e-41f7-8cad-8f54d1634cb2" class="">If we are to create <em>worlds</em>, then so too must we create maps.

It is also not simply enough to create <em>a </em>map, but as recursive trees. There is an adage in computer science, that <em>all problems can be solved with another level of indirection</em>. In a different way, <em>all problems can be solved by nesting maps in maps. </em></p>

<p id="4a761b51-84e9-4198-ac59-071e020e24dd" class="">By now, people are well-aware of this notion of displaying information (computational objects) in terms of recursive containers through products like Notion and Roam. But I’d venture to guess that most understand these as vertically linear arrangements, a stack of “blocks”. Unique about Abelson and diSessa’s design was the use of both horizontal and vertical nesting, and the emphasis on interactivity. These were not meant to be solely media documents, rather they were designed to be dynamic, interactive, computational experiences. </p>

Bederson and Hollan describe a “much richer world” of “dynamic persistent informational entities”. Central to their design is a <em>semantic zoom</em>, which reshapes objects based on how “close” they are to the user in “3D” space. We are familiar with this dynamic in our mapping technologies, which show more, specific and more complete, labels and features as we zoom in, and higher-level, more regional labels and features as we zoom out. </p>

Instead, for the lot of apps I see offered today, the process of moving between levels is delegated to “embedded spaces”, in essence a more graphical form of hyperlinks on the web.
