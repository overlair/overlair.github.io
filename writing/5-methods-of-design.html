Here, we’ll look at five methods for design, drawn from three designers: Bill Verplank, Bill Moggridge and Charles Eames. They are:</p>

				<p id="13ccee6a-77ea-4c7c-b334-4e64744b6d20" class="">We can address Brooks’ caution by reframing it to:</p>

				<blockquote id="33d30be0-711e-40eb-85a3-6fee61cdc094" class="">

				<p id="4d67294e-a97c-4759-8d5f-581b8d22c58d" class="">It is not on process alone that design is made great, but by a skilled designer who knows <em>how</em> and <em>when</em> to use the set of processes in their toolbox. Frederick Brooks knows this better than anyone, having written multiple books on the subject of  software design methodology. </p>

				<p id="18623a04-f2fc-45b7-9ba5-ef72c0cc5509" class="">Thus, we can proceed by caring about processes on two levels. We care about abstract processes, drawn from successful and well-respected designers (like Brooks, Verplank, Moggridge and Eames). These will give rough shape to the work of interaction design, high-level maps for how one takes an idea and makes it an interactive product. </p>

				<p id="8a6a1642-875d-4175-b91b-733098634f4d" class="">We also care about the concrete processes in our specific design work. Defining these is a design process in itself, as we each have unique goals and constraints. The following will avoid these, sticking to the more abstract, general approaches. These serve as material for concrete processes, as high-level methodologies to be made concrete in our own contexts</p>

					<p id="87e0c891-d5f9-4c51-810b-7fcf3f223bfb" class="">Our first process comes from Verplank, who traces the different “orbits” from the seed of an idea to a whole market sector. </p>

					<p id="58dd651e-4324-4f1f-906b-fd32bcc28ca5" class="">We can imagine ideas starting small, as responses to a need (“hack”) or to an inspiration (“hunch”) and growing momentum as they iterate (orbit), eventually gaining the energy to escape to a higher-level design stage. </p>

As we progress levels, we move from these lightweight capture tools to use of increasingly heavier-weight and more precise shaping tools.</p>

<p id="11eb7baf-e128-4afe-863b-300f55b30744" class="">As our seed begins to sprout, we reach for more involved tools: flow charts, wireframes, modeling software, cardboard and paper models, CNC machines, etc. As we continue to orbit, we make increasing commitments of time, material and manpower, moving from a hunch in idea-space → prototypes in test-space → a product in market-space. </p><p id="748de871-dd61-4bd1-b465-cd9f56bf2724" class="">For our purposes, we’ll want to emphasize the layers between “hack” and “product”. These will involve generating alternatives to an idea, testing these prototypes, formulating principles from these tests and synthesizing a product from tested principles. More to come on these later. </p>

<h3 id="63a3058d-e124-4bd0-aab3-353605fd3ae8" class="">Moggridge’s 5 Skills</h3>

<p id="5442851a-1c70-43fe-80b4-b39de4703ca8" class="">Bill Moggridge is the the cofounder of IDEO, as well as the author of one of the seminal interaction design text, <em>Designing Interactions</em>.<em> </em>In it, he outlines five general skills of a designer, transcribed below:</p><ol type="1" id="0d0a48f6-a5e4-48ed-a63f-41497e514a24" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li><em>To synthesize a solution from all of the relevant constraints, understanding everything that will make a difference to the result</em></li></ol><ol type="1" id="03b83fc9-5749-4327-940e-02fc9d4464c9" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><em>To frame, or reframe, the problem and objective</em></li></ol><ol type="1" id="010ccfce-bcf1-437b-bbf1-ae9575a4e8fd" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li><em>To create and envision alternatives</em></li></ol><ol type="1" id="d8e63756-ef95-4ccd-96a9-9046242ff168" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li><em>To select from these alternatives, knowing intuitively how to choose the best approach</em></li></ol><ol type="1" id="5fe16550-fae4-4d94-bb0b-2c6b3144373a" class="numbered-list" start="5"><li><em>To visualize and prototype the intended solution</em></li></ol><p id="eb850c3e-2ca5-4e49-8f7d-1fdc777b1b37" class="">Though Moggridge notes that design flows through these skills in iterative and non-linear ways, we can outline a roughly linear process. Without prescribing that one must necessarily do the steps in the presented order, we can define the following 1-2-3 ordering:</p><ol type="1" id="e50f1837-cbb9-462e-8779-597c4031d9cd" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Frame the problem</li></ol><ol type="1" id="7ce4f201-652b-4fda-9ea7-c9bb20d8c52e" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>Define all dimensions of effects</li></ol><ol type="1" id="5d3a5f34-877f-44c2-9f6f-4f1ff1f71871" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>Synthesize from constraints (by way of visualizations and prototypes)</li></ol><p id="e3e5b9ea-0bcb-4639-865b-48093ce31691" class="">The problem of design is one of navigating space. In <em>framing a problem,</em> we give ourselves orientation, or direction, within this space. We chart our journey by giving it a notion of destination. In <em>defining all dimensions of effects, </em>we are setting boundaries over this space, splitting it into regions we will explore or avoid. By <em>synthesizing from these constraints, </em>we give order to the way we will move through this space, keeping to the explorable regions and heading in the direction of our objective. We move through this space, thinking of possible paths (alternatives), selecting among these (selection) and exploring them (visualize and prototype). </p><p id="4bdd14c5-48e5-4eaa-a7a2-3b5e62d7600b" class="">In this, our goal is to move from lightweight thinking and processes to heavyweight versions. We don’t want to commit all of our energy to one path, but rather spread it across a number of viable paths, and whittle this down over time. By moving from possibilities to probabilities to usabilities,  and scaling up imaginations to sketches to models to products, we make minimal commitments of energy at each point on the design map, allowing us to have the time and energy to explore larger regions of it as a whole. </p>

<p id="88d5302e-4d7b-467e-8ca9-1c75fc4232f9" class="">In addition to outlining a set of skills, Bill Moggridge also gives the elements of the interaction design process. Many of these we’ve touched on before, but we’ll restate them here: Constraints, Synthesis, Framing, Ideation, Envisioning, Uncertainty, Selection, Visualization, Prototyping, Evaluation.</p>

		<p id="7ed38a66-eb2f-4df3-bc12-abdb59ec3432" class="">Bill Ver<em>plank</em> uses a four-step process to outline his design, moving through the stages of motivation, meaning, modes and mappings, and scaling a design from an idea to a set of models, tasks, and interfaces. In order to communicate this process, Verplank uses a 2x4 table, or <em>plank.</em> Thus, we can name this table and overall process “Bill’s Plank”.</p>

We can use Bill’s Plank as a “science”, a means of moving through the different “levels of detail” to our designs.

<p id="6401a078-72d9-40e7-bb68-334739a6f4d4" class="">First, in the image above, we see Charles Eames’ visualization of several Eames Boxes layered. Each represents the interests and concerns of a different relevant party: the design office, the client and society as a whole. In this, Eames’ expands our vision for design beyond the <em>material</em> nature of products, to the <em>relations</em> among the parties involved in the act of design. </p>

		<li><em>and this the area of genuine interest to the client</em></li>
		<li><em>and this the concerns of society as a whole</em></li>
		<li><em>then it is in this area of overlapping interest and concern that the designer can work with conviction and enthusiasm</em></li>

<p id="4e0bc39f-a797-48e6-b013-724b04e65f53" class="">The design process is not a one-shot game, but a repeated one played over many years. By viewing the design process in unbounded terms, we open the process up to being a continual one. This doesn’t mean that our deadlines disappear, but rather that our understanding of deadlines as finish lines erodes, replaced by an always-iterating cycle, spinning until we no longer wish to solve the problem. The <em>journey is the destination, </em>or something like that. </p>



<h3 id="df791a68-8168-4a3a-9697-00ba1a62d64e" class="">Wrap Up</h3>


<p id="d7676cd5-7354-4c19-aec6-44412a7be4a8" class="">Interaction design, and design in general, can be most simply viewed as an iterative process through prototypes to product, as was shown most strongly in Verplank’s Orbits. We commit different levels of investments of labor and capital behind potential paths to our destination, in order to maximize our coverage of the design space. </p>

<p id="eea0f61a-bd8d-4bb8-9b3a-70364262f0a4" class="">As we explore these spaces, we need to pay attention to the constraints at hand, relevant to the project and parties involved, directly and indirectly, as we say in Eames’ Insights. In doing so, we allow constraints to shape our prototypes. </p>

<p id="fc966adc-a35a-4b44-b6e9-99138bbef7ad" class="">In this work, the abilities of visualization and intuition are essential. We need to produce rich representations to choose from, and know how to best select between these. Moggridge’s 5 Skills and his 10 Elements highlight this need. As we move to richer forms, we can use Bill’s Plank to guide this process in the context of software—models, tasks, displays and controls. </p>
